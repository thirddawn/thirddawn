# Hi, I'm Joel
## I'm the lead developer and founder of Third Dawn Studios

My goal is simple, help get my friends off the ground and into successful careers. I am doing this by helping publish projects which they have designed.
Projects like:
- Music Albums
- Steam Games
- Websites
- Hardware
- And so much more...

Finding your purpose is really hard, but doing something useful and finishing a project, you get a whole lot closer. I want my friends to do well, and so I'm here for them.
